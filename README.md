# Resume
Welcome to Frederic-K's Blog v.1 ! This blog is a demo and was created by Frédéric KREUDER as a personal project to practice Full Stack MERN development.

This demo is a simple blog that allows the owner to create, update and delete posts. It also includes a dashboard where he can manage posts, users and comments.

You can consult post which include carousel and lightbox, browse comments and use advanced search to find articles that interest you.

You can also create a account with your email and password, or sign in with Google to leave comments, like posts and comments or get in touch via the contact form.

It was inspired by online courses and self-educated. Reworked, refactored, restyled and enhanced with email validation, forgot my password function, contact form, database cleaning, etc...

The blog is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js. The front-end is built using React and Tailwind CSS, while the back-end is built using Node.js, Express and connected to MongoDB.
